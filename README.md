# CDKTN Go bindings for snowflakedb/snowflake provider version 2.13.0

This repo builds and publishes the [Terraform snowflake provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.13.0/docs) bindings for [CDK Terrain](https://cdktn.io).

## Go Package

The go package is generated into the [`github.com/cdktn-io/cdktn-provider-snowflake-go`](https://github.com/cdktn-io/cdktn-provider-snowflake-go) package.

`go get github.com/cdktn-io/cdktn-provider-snowflake-go/snowflake/<version>`

Where `<version>` is the version of the prebuilt provider you would like to use e.g. `v11`. The full module name can be found
within the [go.mod](https://github.com/cdktn-io/cdktn-provider-snowflake-go/blob/main/snowflake/go.mod#L1) file.

## Docs

Find auto-generated docs for this provider [here](https://github.com/cdktn-io/cdktn-provider-snowflake/blob/main/docs/API.go.md).


## Versioning

This project is explicitly not tracking the Terraform snowflake provider version 1:1. In fact, it always tracks `latest` of ` ~> 2.0` with every release. If there are scenarios where you explicitly have to pin your provider version, you can do so by [generating the provider constructs manually](https://cdktn.io/docs/concepts/providers#import-providers).

These are the upstream dependencies:

* [CDK Terrain](https://cdktn.io) - Last official release
* [Terraform snowflake provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.13.0)
* [Terraform Engine](https://terraform.io)

If there are breaking changes (backward incompatible) in any of the above, the major version of this project will be bumped.
